            <div>

                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Ryan Marzigliano. This is my biography of my About Me 
                    website. For starters, I am following the degree path of becoming an
                    IT Professionalist. My degree, Information Systems and Technology, 
                    provides me with a multitude of new jobs, such as a Computer Research
                    Scientist, Software Developer, Webpage Designer, etc. Beside's schooling, 
                    I work at a newly opened gym in town called Planet Fitness. I have 
                    participated in many sports, such as soccer, tennis, swim, golf, track,
                    and marching band. I enjoy working out, playing the drumset, and playing
                    video games. I graduated from Warren Hills Regional High School. I have
                    three dogs, that are shown in an image and video below, named Pluto, Lane, 
                    and Saki. Last but not least, my favorite color is blue.

                <h2>Blog: CSS Animations</h2>

                <div>

                    <p>CSS Animation is a very interesting topic to discuss. Not only does it provide more pizazz 
                        to your webpage, but it can give your website a unique factor to it, depending on what 
                        animations you use and how many you do use. You can change whatever you want, whenever 
                        you want, however you want with the use of CSS Animation tools. But, to animate in CSS, 
                        you must be familiar with the keyframes rule. Keyframes contains the elements from and to, 
                        which are essential to changing the css from one style to another. As well as this, keyframes 
                        uses a percentage number to determine when animation will take place in a sequence. 0% 
                        is the beginning of an animation, and 100% shows that the animation has completed. Once
                        you establish the keyframes, the animation will take place and the current style will 
                        change to a new style, and this happens whenever the coder wants it to happen and it 
                        can turn into pretty much any style possible. The animation must be binded to an element
                        for it to work. Getting deeper into the code, the animation-duration aspect will determine 
                        how long the entire animation will take. Animation-name gives a specific name to keyframes.
                        Animation-play-state gives the webpage user the option to pause and start the animation. 
                        The animation-delay will delay the animation by any desired amount. Animation-iteration-count
                        will determine how many times the animation occurs before stopping. Animation-direction shows
                        what direction the animation will take place. Under this, the following codes will be used: 
                        Normal – the animation is played regularly, reverse – animation goes in a reverse direction, 
                        alternate – animation is played forwards normally then backwards, and finally alternate-reverse 
                        – the animation is played backwards then forwards. Using the animation-timing-function sets how 
                        fast the animation will take place. Under this property, using ease will start the animation slowly, 
                        then get faster, then slower. Linear will give the animation the same speed from start to end. 
                        Ease-in will have a slow start, and ease-out will have a slow end. Ease-in-out will give you a 
                        slow start and end. Finally, cubic-bezier(n, n, n, n) will let you choose your own timing. 
                        Finally, the last property is animation-fill-mode. This can have the following values: none, 
                        forwards, backwards, and both. None is default, meaning the animation will not apply styles 
                        to an element before or after the animation occurs. Forwards means the element will keep the 
                        style last used on it. Backwards means the style values will be the same as the first keyframe. 
                        Finally, the both value gives the animation both forwards and backwards properties. Now, I’m not 
                        sure if you, the webpage reader, saw the animation example I have incorporated into my website. 
                        If you did, great! But if you didn’t, it is probably because the animation occurred when you loaded 
                        up this page. My example of this CSS animation is actually this entire paragraph, so if you could 
                        please refresh the page and look at this paragraph, there will be an animation happening. </p>
