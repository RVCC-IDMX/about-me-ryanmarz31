# About Me README

## Description of this README

Hi, my name is **Ryan Marzigliano.** This is my repo's README.md page,
and included in the following text is what I have decided to do
about my about me project, what I plan to do from here on out,
and a few other various things that I have incorporated into
my About Me Project.

## My Name and Netlify Status Badge

As I said previously, my name is Ryan Marzigliano, and this webpage
is all about me! Using Netlify, they provide many resources to help
me produce this webpage and see the process in making a website. Here
is my Netlify Status Badge.
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/76989568-6862-4c80-9036-488a3aaf4b72/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/about-me-ryanmarz31/deploys)

## Description of this project and it's utilities I have learned

Being able to complete and create this assignment over the semester was
such a good experience and project because I actually had hands on work
to see how to do certain things when creating a website, unlike other
classes that don't have nearly as much hands on work. There is such a variety 
of different skills that I have learned from this class, and I'll begin 
listing them. To start off, understanding how a website is first established
and put on the internet was very cool to me and I was happy to see that I was
able to do it. Then, understanding how to add images and create a variety of 
different color schemes and text options to a website was very valuble
in my webpage design knowledge. When I combined this project with GitHub and 
Netlify, I was so confused. I didn't really understand what I was doing, but 
after watching the videos multiple times and doing the work hands on, I was
able to have a much better understanding of how these websites can help me
in my webpage design life. The coding that was written into the entire project
was just amazing too, because I was able to see what code writes what and what the
outcome looks like. Understanding the hierarchies of the code, such as what comes
first and what is contained inside what is essential to my understanding of
HTML and thanks to this project, I successfully understood that topic. 
Something else that I know I still want to progress in is grid and flex. As of
right now, I'm not too big of a fan of flex and grid just because I still get
confused by it sometimes, but I understand how useful it can be so I want to look
more into it. Things like creating a contact form and incorporating a video
into the website are really fascinating things as well. I never thought I would
be able to do that by the end of this semester. After finishing the final touches, being able to edit and change the bird logo into my own logo and figure out what specific things I want to change and make better gave me a good opportunity to 
expand on what I know and add in things that fit my taste, rather than following
a specific code plan. Finally, being able to research my own topic to learn about was really
good for me because I chose CSS Animations, and looking into this topic, I can see many new
ways of how I can make a website look more interesting and professional.

## Color Scheme

Throughout this project, I really only have 4 color's that make up the 
majority of the project. These colors are: 

<font color=#2914B3> This is the text color of the text. It's Hex Number is 2914B3 
and it's RGB is (41,20,179). </font>

<font color=#5036FE> This is the color of the borders. It's Hex Number is 5036FE and
it's RGB is (80,54,254). </font>

<font color=#B39B02> This is the color of the background inside the borders.
It's Hex Number is B39B02 and it's RGB is (179,155,2). </font>

<font color=#FFDF0F> This is the color of the background. It's Hex Number is 
FFDF0F and it's RGB is (255,223,15). </font>
